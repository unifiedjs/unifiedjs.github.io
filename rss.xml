For us that’s typically markup languages.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>As a JavaScript developer you may already know things that are like ASTs: The DOM and React’s virtual DOM. Or you may have heard of Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, Prettier, or TypeScript. They all use ASTs to inspect and transform code.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>In &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unified/" class="">unified&#x3C;/a>, we support &#x3C;em>several&#x3C;/em> ASTs. The reason for different ASTs is that each markup language has several aspects that do not translate 1-to-1 to other markup languages. Taking markdown and HTML as an example, in some cases markdown has more info than HTML: markdown has several ways to add a link (“autolinks”: &#x3C;code>&#x26;#x3C;https://url>&#x3C;/code>, resource links: &#x3C;code>[label](url)&#x3C;/code>, and reference links with definitions: &#x3C;code>[label][id]&#x3C;/code> and &#x3C;code>[id]: url&#x3C;/code>). In other cases, HTML has more info than markdown. It has many tags, which add new meaning (semantics), that aren’t available in markdown. If there was one AST, it would be quite hard to do the tasks that several &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/project/remarkjs/remark/" class="">remark&#x3C;/a> and &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/project/rehypejs/rehype/" class="">rehype&#x3C;/a> plugins now do.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>See &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/recipe/build-a-syntax-tree/">“How to build a syntax tree”&#x3C;/a> for more info on how to make a tree. See &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/syntax-trees-typescript/">“Syntax trees in TypeScript”&#x3C;/a> on how to work with ASTs in TypeScript.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;h3 id="user-content-what-is-unist">&#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/introduction-to-syntax-trees/#what-is-unist" class="" aria-label="Link to self">&#x3C;/a>What is unist?&#x3C;/h3>&#x3C;p>But all our ASTs have things in common. The bit in common is called &#x3C;a href="https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist" class="">unist&#x3C;/a>. By having a shared interface, we can also share tools that work on all ASTs. In practice, that means you can use for example &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unist-util-visit/">&#x3C;code>unist-util-visit&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/a> to visit nodes in any supported AST.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>See &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/recipe/tree-traversal/">“Tree traversal”&#x3C;/a> for more info on &#x3C;code>unist-util-visit&#x3C;/code>.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>&#x3C;a href="https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist" class="">unist&#x3C;/a> is different from the ASTs used in other tools. Quite noticeable because it uses a particular set of names for things: &#x3C;code>type&#x3C;/code>, &#x3C;code>children&#x3C;/code>, &#x3C;code>position&#x3C;/code>. But perhaps harder to see is that it’s compatible with JSON. It’s all objects and arrays. Strings, numbers. Where other tools use instances with methods, we use plain data. Years ago in &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/project/retextjs/retext/" class="">retext&#x3C;/a> we started out like that too. But we found that we preferred to be able to read and write a tree from/to a JSON file, to treat ASTs as data, and use more functional utilities.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;h3 id="user-content-when-to-use-an-ast">&#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/introduction-to-syntax-trees/#when-to-use-an-ast" class="" aria-label="Link to self">&#x3C;/a>When to use an AST?&#x3C;/h3>&#x3C;p>You can use an AST when you want to inspect or transform content.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>Say you wanted to count the number of headings in a markdown file. You could also do that with a regex:&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;div>&#x3C;pre>&#x3C;code class="language-js">const value = `# Pluto

Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt.

## History

### Discovery

In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the
position of…`

const expression = /^#+[^\r\n]+/gm
const headings = [...value.matchAll(expression)].length

console.log(headings) //=> 3
&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/pre>&#x3C;/div>&#x3C;p>But what if the headings were in a code block? Or if Setext headings were used instead of ATX headings? The grammar of markdown is more complex than a regex can handle. That’s where an AST can help.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;div>&#x3C;pre>&#x3C;code class="language-js">import {fromMarkdown} from 'mdast-util-from-markdown'
import {visit} from 'unist-util-visit'

const value = `# Pluto

Almost all the projects can be used anywhere: in Bun, Deno, Node.js, on the edge, or in browsers. To use our projects in a browser, you need to do one or two things. And there’s different ways to go about it.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;h3 id="user-content-contents">&#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/unified-in-the-browser/#contents" class="" aria-label="Link to self">&#x3C;/a>Contents&#x3C;/h3>&#x3C;ul>&#x3C;li>&#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/unified-in-the-browser/#bundle">Bundle&#x3C;/a>&#x3C;/li>&#x3C;li>&#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/unified-in-the-browser/#cdn">CDN&#x3C;/a>&#x3C;/li>&#x3C;/ul>&#x3C;h3 id="user-content-bundle">&#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/unified-in-the-browser/#bundle" class="" aria-label="Link to self">&#x3C;/a>Bundle&#x3C;/h3>&#x3C;p>A common way to use &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unified/" class="">unified&#x3C;/a> in the browser is to bundle it with a bundler. You perhaps know bundlers already: webpack, Rollup, or esbuild. You might be using one. Or otherwise have a favorite. If not, &#x3C;a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild&#x3C;/a> is a good choice.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>Bundling is almost always a good idea. It gives end users a single file to download. Often minified.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>Say we have some code using &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unified/" class="">unified&#x3C;/a> in &#x3C;code>example.js&#x3C;/code>:&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;div>&#x3C;pre>&#x3C;code class="language-js">import rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'
import remarkParse from 'remark-parse'
import remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'
import {unified} from 'unified'

const file = await unified()
  .use(remarkParse)
  .use(remarkRehype)
  .use(rehypeStringify)
  .process('Hello, *world*!')

console.log(String(file))
&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/pre>&#x3C;/div>&#x3C;p>And you want to use that in some HTML called &#x3C;code>index.html&#x3C;/code>:&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;pre>&#x3C;code class="language-html">&#x26;#x3C;!doctype html>
&#x26;#x3C;meta charset=utf8>
&#x26;#x3C;title>Example&#x26;#x3C;/title>
&#x26;#x3C;script src=example.min.js type=module>&#x26;#x3C;/script>
&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/pre>&#x3C;p>To make &#x3C;code>example.js&#x3C;/code> work in the browser, you can bundle it with esbuild. First, set up a package. Go to the folder in your terminal and run:&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;pre>&#x3C;code class="language-sh">npm init --yes
npm install esbuild --save-dev rehype-stringify remark-parse remark-rehype unified
&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/pre>&#x3C;p>Then, bundle &#x3C;code>example.js&#x3C;/code>:&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;pre>&#x3C;code class="language-sh">npx esbuild --bundle --format=esm --minify --outfile=example.min.js example.js
&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/pre>&#x3C;p>Now, open &#x3C;code>index.html&#x3C;/code> in a browser. When you open the console of your developer tools, you should see &#x3C;code>Hello, &#x26;#x3C;em>world&#x26;#x3C;/em>!&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>You probably also want to configure the target environment for the browsers that you support. That way, JavaScript syntax which is too new for some browsers, will be transformed into older JavaScript syntax that works. Pass the &#x3C;a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api/#target">&#x3C;code>--target&#x3C;/code>&#x3C;/a> flag to do this.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;h3 id="user-content-cdn">&#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/learn/guide/unified-in-the-browser/#cdn" class="" aria-label="Link to self">&#x3C;/a>CDN&#x3C;/h3>&#x3C;p>If you don’t want to bundle &#x3C;a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/unified/" class="">unified&#x3C;/a> yourself, you can use a CDN.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>A CDN hosts files for you. And they can process them for you as well. The nice thing is that you do not have to install and bundle things yourself. The downside is that you’re dependent on a particular server that you do not control.&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;p>One such CDN is &#x3C;a href="https://esm.sh/">esm.sh&#x3C;/a>. Like the code above, you can use it in a browser like this:&#x3C;/p>&#x3C;pre>&#x3C;code class="language-html">&#x26;#x3C;!doctype html>
