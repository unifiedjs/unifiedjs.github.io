> Building a bridge between formats

unified is an ecosystem for dealing with content in its many forms.
It enables [Gatsby][] to pull in markdown as data to make blazing fast sites.
It’s what generates the HTML for [Node][]’s API docs.
It’s what allows [Prettier][] to format markdown.
It’s what lets you write JSX inside markdown when you’re creating a
presentation with [mdx-deck][].

## <Logo name="micromark" /><Indicator />

**micromark** is a low-level markdown parser in JavaScript.
In nerdy terms, it’s a lexer.

It’s a new project under the unified umbrella that’s smaller, faster, and
compliant to commonmark.
We’re building it to lay a better foundation for markdown parsers like
[remark][] build from the beginning to support extensions like [mdx][].
micromark is written in TypeScript so that it’s possible to compile it to WASM.

micromark will allow other projects to create a CST from markdown and will
provide a better base for remark.

## Collective<Indicator />

The current landscape of open source software seems to indicate that only big,
existing projects, with a giant direct user base, can be sustainable.
We believe that projects which are more low-level, like unified, and projects
which are new, like [micromark][], should also be sustainable.

To reach this goal, we’re creating a collective of hundreds of projects,
spanning from low-level building blocks to high-level user-facing projects,
all sharing the same support pool.
