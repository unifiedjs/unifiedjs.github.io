> Building a bridge between formats

unified is an ecosystem for dealing with many sources of content and
enables [Gatsby][] to pull in markdown as data to make blazing fast sites.

allows [Prettier][] to format markdown.
It lets you write JSX inside markdown when
you’re creating a presentation with [mdx-deck][].

## <Logo name="micromark" /><Indicator />

**micromark** is a new, tiny, and fast, markdown parser written in TypeScript

## Collective<Indicator />

The current landscape of open source software seems to indicate that only big,
existing projects, with a giant direct user base, can be sustainable.
We believe that projects which are more low-level, like unified, and projects
which are new, like [micromark][], should also be sustainable.

To reach this goal, we’re creating a collective of hundreds of projects,
spanning from low-level building blocks to high-level user-facing projects,
all sharing the same support pool.
