## How to narrow generic `Node` to specific syntax types

To work with a specific node type or a set of node types we need to
[narrow](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html) their
type.
For example, we can take a `Node` and perform a type safe check to get a more
specific type like a `Link`.
Unified provides a utility to help with this and there are some TypeScript
language features which can also help.
Letâ€™s first take a look at `unist-util-is`.

[`unist-util-is`](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist-util-is#readme) takes a
`Node` and a `Test` and returns whether the test passes.
It can be used as a [TypeScript type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates)
which when used as a condition (such as in an if-statement) tells TypeScript
to narrow a node.

For example:

```ts
import type {Node, Literal} from 'unist'
import type {List, Blockquote, Strong, Emphasis, Heading} from 'mdast'
import {is, convert} from 'unist-util-is'

// `Node` could come from a plugin, a utility, or be passed into a function
// here we hard code a Node for testing purposes
const node: Node = {type: 'example'}

if (is<List>(node, 'list')) {
  // If we're here, node is List.
  //
  // 'list' is compared to node.type to make sure they match
  // true means a match, false means no match
  //
  // <List> tells TypeScript to ensure 'list' matches List.type
  // and that if 'list' matches both node.type and List.type
  // we know that node is List within this if condition.
}

if (is<Strong | Emphasis>(node, ['strong', 'emphasis'])) {
  // If we get here, node is Strong or Emphasis

  // If we want even more specific type, we can use a discriminated union
  // https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#discriminated-unions
  if (node.type === 'emphasis') {
    // If we get here, node is Emphasis
  }
}

if (is<Heading>(node, {type: 'heading', depth: 1})) {
  // If we get here, node is Heading
  //
  // Typescript checks that the properties used in the Test
  // are valid attributes of <Heading>
  //
  // It does not narrow node.depth only be 1,
  // which can be done with <Heading & {depth: 1}>
}

// For advanced use cases, another predicate can be passed to `is`
if (is<Literal>(node, (node: Node): node is Literal => 'value' in node)) {
  // If we get here, node is one of the Literal types
  //
  // Here any comparison function can be used, as long as it is a predicate
  // https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates
  // and as long as the predicate and generic match.
  // For example here, <Literal> and `is Literal` match.
}

// Reusable predicates can also be created using any `Test`
const isBlockquote = convert<Blockquote>('blockquote')
if (isBlockquote(node)) {
  // If we get here, node is Blockquote
}
```
